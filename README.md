# SFM QuickLauncher 3 - Now With SFM Auto-Detection!

It is going to be a tool that will allow me to quickly by using "1" "2" and "3" to enter SFM in "editing mode", "render mode" and "open SFM game folder" relatively quickly.
I mainly make it for myself, but I do want to make it so others are able to use it.

What it can do right now:
* Go through Steam Libraries, not just the one on C-drive
* Check which of those drives has SFM on them
* Tell you the path to SFM (as long as there are only one SFM installed at the moment)

Planned functionality:
* Auto-detect SFM location and save it to a config file of sorts.
* Check if SFM is where the config file says it is.
* Check if Steam is staretd up/blocked on network (Automatically determine if "-nosteam" should be applied or not.)
* Allow user to quickly overide Online/Offline mode quickly.
* Automatically set up "1", "2" and "3" to be "editing mode (default)", "render mode (4k resoluton)" and "open SFM game folder (I visit it way more than I'd like to)".
